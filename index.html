        Do you ever wonder about yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
        It's easy to do. We see how others act and we wonder how we fit in. One way to find out more about yourself is to take a personality test.
        If you want to learn about yourself, you can take the Meyers Briggs Personality Test <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">here.</a> It's fast, easy and enlightening.
        However, the results are more complicated. If you want to be trendy, you can take the Enneagram <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/enneagram-personality-test">here.</a> It gets worse results, but hey, it's trendy
        However, if you want another personality test to group you or your students quickly into four basic groups, then you're in the right place.
        The True Colors Personality Test helps you understand yourself, and you can take it right here!
